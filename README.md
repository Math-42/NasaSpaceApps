# TESS : Telecom Engineering Space Simulator
![TESS logo](https://github.com/Math-42/NasaSpaceApps/blob/master/assets/images/TESS.png)


TESS is the immersive interactive experience that puts you in charge of an interplanetary (EARTH - MARS) communication system, a software designed to resemble the golden era of NASA and space exploration, nodding at MS-DOS interfaces of the late 20th century.
Taking inspiration from *indie classics* such as *Papers, please* and *TIS-100* we are offering a puzzle game where your choices have real impact on a deep branching story that nods at Bowie's desolation portrayed in *Space Oddity*.

## Gameplay
You are an engineer located on planeth Earth in charge of remotely solving problems happening on Mars through an **asynchronous** communication system: messages take a long time to travel, so **every byte counts**, there can be no **wasted messages**. You must use the Manual included in your software to find effective solutions for those problems: not only the mission success depends on you but there are human lives that depend on your choices.
This is a game with multiple endings based on your choices.
